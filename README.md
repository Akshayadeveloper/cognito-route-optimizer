<b>Focus:</b> Optimization of non-linear, constraint-based scheduling and resource allocation.

<b>Core Problem Solved :</b>

Optimizes complex resource problems (e.g., virtual machine placement, industrial job scheduling, advanced logistics) where the cost function is non-linear and constraints are numerous. This solution utilizes Simulated Annealing for global optimal search, outperforming greedy or simple genetic algorithms in highly constrained environments.

<b>The Solution Mechanism (Python) :</b>

The core mechanism is a flexible Simulated Annealing optimizer designed for discrete configuration spaces.
